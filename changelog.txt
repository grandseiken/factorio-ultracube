---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 22.02.2024
  Changes:
    - Doubled the crafting time of the qubit recipe to match the fact it now makes two qubits per craft as of 0.5.0.
    - Updated the nuclear reactor tips and tricks item to reflect the 0.5.0 behaviour.
  Bugfixes:

  Minor Features:
    - Added several more Ultracube-specific entries to the in-game tips and tricks menu.
  Changes:
    - Several recipes have been adjusted to address end-game resource imbalances, particularly of rare metals and calcium.
    - Adjusted recipes are: qubits, singularity calibration data, and the final science card. The latter two now require an additional ingredient each.
    - Nuclear reactors now require kickstarting with the cube once they run out of uranium fuel cells, regardless of temperature.
    - The neighbour bonus of nuclear reactors has been reduced from 50% to 25%.
    - Somewhat reduced the resource investment necessary to create tier 2 and 3 modules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.4
Date: 01. 02. 2024
  Changes:
    - Slightly increased roboport construction range so that bots can deconstruct objects in the way of the next roboport when building a grid remotely.
    - Moved the menu simulation template scenario somewhere else so it doesn't show up and get clicked by accident.
  Modding:
    - Marked Power Grid Comb as incompatible since it can cause issues with the backup turbine.
    - Made some entity cleanup scripting more crash-resilient when interfered with by incompatible mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3
Date: 29. 01. 2024
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed and improved interaction of several scripted composite entities with the pipette tool (Q) and the Picker Dollies mod.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 28. 01. 2024
  Minor Features:
    - Introduced the backup turbine, a limited generator that can provide small amounts of power only to nearby entities, available from the start of the game. It can be used, for example, to ensure critical combinators remain operational during a power outage, or as part of a power failure recovery bootstrapping system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 25. 01. 2024

    - The stack sizes of several mid-game items have been reduced (deep core ore, deep powder, and ghost crystals). Deep-core mining setups may require some adjustment.
    - Construction robots now use the vanilla prototype for better compatibility with Recursive Blueprints, which relies on the vanilla construction robot signal.
  Major Features:
    - A new endgame technology allows for better parallelisation of some combinations of processes in certain situations, but will take some work to apply effectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 07. 01. 2024
  Changes:
    - This version makes some changes to later-game technologies which could necessitate some factory modifications if you have progressed far enough. See other notes for details.
    - The nuclear reactor has been reworked with more robust logic. Its heat connections now connect only once kickstarted by cube, and there's always at least a short window after this to insert a uranium fuel cell even if most of its heat flows out immediately. This should make it easier to automate restarting via cube if desired, since a single cube use should now always be enough to bring one reactor online.
    - Cubes currently inside reactors may be lost during migration to the new format. Save your game with the cube elsewhere before updating to avoid the need to spawn a new cube with console commands. Reactors will need to be kickstarted again after updating.
    - Several uranium-related recipes have been reworked. Reprocessing uranium fuel cells no longer requires the cube, but creating them in the first place now requires significantly more of it. An improved fuel cell recipe can be now unlocked with kovarex processing.
    - Tendrils now stack to 50, down from 100.
    - The subatomic conduits recipe now requires an additional ingredient.
    - Renamed a certain late-game recipe and associated technology and increased its power usage.
    - Reworked systems for detecting and supporting compatibility with other mods. Added a compatibility guide for those who want to add support for Ultracube in their mods.
  Minor Features:
    - Riding a train while carrying the ultradense cube in your inventory will now also trigger the transitive ultralocomotion technology.
    - Added optional compatibility with Safe Waterfill.
    - Added optional compatibility with Recursive Blueprints and Recursive Blueprints+.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue where reactors could duplicate themselves.
    - Fixed an issue where the cube couldn't be found after manually placing it in the burnt fuel result inventory of a machine.
  Modding:
    - Marked the Merging Chests mod as incompatible for now since it leads to script errors.
