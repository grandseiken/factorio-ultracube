    - Removed compatibility with deprecated 2.0 mods, including: Automatic Fuel Train Stop, Spidertron Patrols, Stack Combinator, and Wire Shortcuts.
    - All optionals mods listed on the mod page have been given a quick check for basic functionality and should now either work with Ultracube on 2.0, have a note listing why they don't yet (mostly because the haven't been updated yet), or have been moved to a separate section for deprecated previously-compatible 1.1-only mods.
  Changes:
    - Removed unncessary additional detail tooltip clutter from byproducts of module recipes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 03.11.2024
  Major Features:
    - Ultracube is now (only) compatible with Factorio 2.0.
    - Everything appears to be more-or-less working, but there could still be some tendrils lurking somewhere. Please consider this an experimental release and report any problems on the mod discussion page or discord.
    - Once this version is stable, future updates will take advantage of more 2.0 features and provide optional expansion-only content for those who have it.
  Modding:
    - Other optional mods which were previously compatible with Ultracube for Factorio 1.0 have not yet been extensively tested or verified. They might or might not still work.
  Changes:
    - Added support for selector combinators and display panels.
    - Added optional support for the elevated rails expansion mod.
    - Added a mod setting to allow circuit connections on machines. Since the inability to easily read machine contents was originally part of the challenge, this can be left disabled for "classic" gameplay.
    - Removed filter inserters and stack filter inserters, and renamed stack inserters to bulk inserters to match the base game.
    - Added a cubecam shortcut button to the toolbar.
    - Rearranged the positions of item and fluid signals to better match the character's recipe GUI and fit with the new recipe signals.
    - Updated items to take advantage of new pickup and placement sounds.
    - Entities set to inactive by script for some reason will have a custom status message shown.
    - The "Show only essential technologies" button in the tech tree will show a simplified flow of the Ultracube tech tree progression.
    - Production statistics will better reflect the net effect of cyclic recipes.
    - Updated the mystery furnace to have spookier flames.
    - Removed extra detail tooltips for uninteresting byproducts of certain recipes, particularly for recipes that output one of their inputs.
    - Due to rocket silo changes in the base game, the experimental teleporter is now more experimental than ever. It has a single inventory slot used for both input and output, and is capable of buffering a second calibration.
    - Players who accidentally obtain excess cubes should now have them confiscated.
  Balancing:
    - Reduced the volume of the beacon input fluidbox from 100 to 10.
    - Increased the yield of the Altered Components recipe.
    - Efficiency modules are now allowed in beacons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4
Date: 13.04.2024
  Changes:
    - Removed SimHelper dependency and updated menu simulations for compatibility with Factorio 1.1.107.

    - Fixed that the cyclotron charge core would be in the wrong place after copy-pasting a rotated cyclotron.
  Modding:
    - Added an experimental cube_info remote interface which can be called to retrieve information about what the cube is up to. See control.lua for documentation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 22.02.2024
  Changes:
    - Doubled the crafting time of the qubit recipe to match the fact it now makes two qubits per craft as of 0.5.0.
    - Updated the nuclear reactor tips and tricks item to reflect the 0.5.0 behaviour.

  Minor Features:
    - Added several more Ultracube-specific entries to the in-game tips and tricks menu.
  Changes:
    - Several recipes have been adjusted to address end-game resource imbalances, particularly of rare metals and calcium.
    - Adjusted recipes are: qubits, singularity calibration data, and the final science card. The latter two now require an additional ingredient each.
    - Nuclear reactors now require kickstarting with the cube once they run out of uranium fuel cells, regardless of temperature.
    - The neighbour bonus of nuclear reactors has been reduced from 50% to 25%.
    - Somewhat reduced the resource investment necessary to create tier 2 and 3 modules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.4
Date: 01. 02. 2024
  Changes:
    - Slightly increased roboport construction range so that bots can deconstruct objects in the way of the next roboport when building a grid remotely.
    - Moved the menu simulation template scenario somewhere else so it doesn't show up and get clicked by accident.
  Modding:
    - Marked Power Grid Comb as incompatible since it can cause issues with the backup turbine.
    - Made some entity cleanup scripting more crash-resilient when interfered with by incompatible mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3
Date: 29. 01. 2024
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed and improved interaction of several scripted composite entities with the pipette tool (Q) and the Picker Dollies mod.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 28. 01. 2024
  Minor Features:
    - Introduced the backup turbine, a limited generator that can provide small amounts of power only to nearby entities, available from the start of the game. It can be used, for example, to ensure critical combinators remain operational during a power outage, or as part of a power failure recovery bootstrapping system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 25. 01. 2024
  Changes:
    - Infinite mining productivity research cost is no longer exponential, and now scales more like vanilla.

Version: 0.4.0
Date: 23. 01. 2024
  Changes:
    - Reduced the inventory size of the logistics storage chest to 20 to match other logistic chests (this will result in the loss of items in slots beyond the new capacity).
    - The stack sizes of several mid-game items have been reduced (deep core ore, deep powder, and ghost crystals). Deep-core mining setups may require some adjustment.
    - Construction robots now use the vanilla prototype for better compatibility with Recursive Blueprints, which relies on the vanilla construction robot signal.
  Major Features:
    - A new endgame technology allows for better parallelisation of some combinations of processes in certain situations, but will take some work to apply effectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 07. 01. 2024
  Changes:
    - This version makes some changes to later-game technologies which could necessitate some factory modifications if you have progressed far enough. See other notes for details.
    - The nuclear reactor has been reworked with more robust logic. Its heat connections now connect only once kickstarted by cube, and there's always at least a short window after this to insert a uranium fuel cell even if most of its heat flows out immediately. This should make it easier to automate restarting via cube if desired, since a single cube use should now always be enough to bring one reactor online.
    - Cubes currently inside reactors may be lost during migration to the new format. Save your game with the cube elsewhere before updating to avoid the need to spawn a new cube with console commands. Reactors will need to be kickstarted again after updating.
    - Several uranium-related recipes have been reworked. Reprocessing uranium fuel cells no longer requires the cube, but creating them in the first place now requires significantly more of it. An improved fuel cell recipe can be now unlocked with kovarex processing.
    - Tendrils now stack to 50, down from 100.
    - The subatomic conduits recipe now requires an additional ingredient.
    - Renamed a certain late-game recipe and associated technology and increased its power usage.
    - Reworked systems for detecting and supporting compatibility with other mods. Added a compatibility guide for those who want to add support for Ultracube in their mods.
  Minor Features:
    - Riding a train while carrying the ultradense cube in your inventory will now also trigger the transitive ultralocomotion technology.
    - Added optional compatibility with Safe Waterfill.
    - Added optional compatibility with Recursive Blueprints and Recursive Blueprints+.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue where reactors could duplicate themselves.
    - Fixed an issue where the cube couldn't be found after manually placing it in the burnt fuel result inventory of a machine.
  Modding:
    - Marked the Merging Chests mod as incompatible for now since it leads to script errors.
