[entity-description]
cube-construction-robot-0=Automatically build and repair friendly entities.
cube-logistic-robot-0=Transports items between logistic chests.
cube-logistic-robot-1=Transports items between logistic chests (best effort).

cube-boiler=Uses ultradense cube energy to turn water into steam.
cube-lab=Unpacks stored knowledge.
cube-recovery-bay=Uses electrical energy to recharge the ultradense cube.
cube-synthesizer=Synthesizes a variety of materials using the ultradense cube.
cube-dimension-folding-engine=Engine capable of dimensional manipulation.
cube-fabricator=Capable of assembling a wide range of products from raw materials.
cube-deep-core-ultradrill=Must output directly into a chest to work at full capacity.
cube-stygian-energy-lab=Harnesses haunted energy cells to drive turbines with winds from beyond the void.
cube-heavy-turbine=Consumes powerful flow to create electric energy.
cube-nuclear-reactor=Uses uranium fuel cells to generate heat. The reaction must be kick-started with the ultradense cube. Heat output increases when built next to other reactors.
cube-cyclotron=Must be carefully charged before operation. A full charge takes 80 seconds at 3MW, and is enough for a single use.
cube-cyclotron-interface=Dedicated 240MJ energy storage for the cyclotron. Charges at 3MW. A full charge is enough for a single use.
cube-particle-phase-aligner=Activates and cycles qubits through their various flavours.
cube-quantum-decoder=Analyzes qubits in pairs. The required pairing of input qubit types is selected uniformly at random among all possible combinations after each successful decode.
cube-beacon=Consumes 2 units of beacon juice per second to transmit the effect of modules to nearby friendly entities. A machine affected by more than one beacon will become overloaded and stop working.
cube-experimental-teleporter=Requires power and control modules for calibration. An item or player placed in a calibrated teleporter can be transmitted instantly to another. If more than one other teleporter is calibrated and ready to receive, the destination is random.
cube-antimatter-reactor=Generates power from matter-antimatter annihilation. Capable of providing 6GW of power for each fully-saturated input port, for a combined total of 24GW. As any excess energy is lost, bulk storage will be necessary to avoid waste.
cube-antimatter-reactor-port=Each port is capable of consuming the output of a single annihilation chamber operating at full capacity. As power production cannot scale down to match demand, any uncaptured excess energy will be lost.
cube-annihilation-chamber=Facilitates matter-antimatter annihilation. The resulting ionization stream will power an antimatter reactor, provided the associated high-volume gamma waste is dealt with.
